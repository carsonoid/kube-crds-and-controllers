# Example client-go Vendoring Via godep

[Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) is still very much supported by client-go. Official instructions are available [in the client-go INSTALL.md doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/v6.0.0/INSTALL.md).

This folder includes a `Godep` folder that is generated when using godep for client-go vendoring as well as a sample controller using the vendored dependencies.

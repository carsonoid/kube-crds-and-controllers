# Examples client-go v6.0.0 Vendoring

Vendoring has been a tricky thing with client-go. As of v6.0.0 you can do vendoring with three major tools.

  * `Godep` and `glide` work well out of the box
  * `dep` is not officially supported. But you can get it to work with a lot of manual version overriding.

Check out each project's director for examples. They all contain the exact same code. But each uses a different vendoring tool.
